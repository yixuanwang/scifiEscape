## Description
Inspired by a board game called _Escape From the Aliens in Outer Space_.

Each player is either a human or a werewolf. Humans have to try to reach the buildings while werewolves have to try to kill the humans. Every turn, humans get to move one step and werewolves, up to two. If a player lands on a dangerous tile, they have to draw a card from the deck.

## What's next for Werewolf Escape
Ongoing project.
